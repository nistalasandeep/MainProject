###Introduction
##Android provides a rich application framework that allows you to build innovative apps and games for mobile devices in a Java language environment
##The documents listed in the left navigation provide details about how to build apps using Android's various APIs
###Application Fundamentals
##Android apps are written in the Java programming language
##The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
##By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them
##Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps
##That covers the basics regarding how an Android app exists within the system
##App components are the essential building blocks of an Android app
##There are four different types of app components
##A content provider manages a shared set of app data
###App Components
##Android's application framework lets you create rich and innovative apps using a set of reusable components
##This section explains how you can build the components that define the building blocks of your app and how to connect them together using intents
###Intents and Intent Filters
##An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component
##Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use-cases
##An Activity represents a single screen in an app. You can start a new instance of an Activity by passing an Intent to startActivity
##The Intent describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data
###Activities
##An application usually consists of multiple activities that are loosely bound to each other
